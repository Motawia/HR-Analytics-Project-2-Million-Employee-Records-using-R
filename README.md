# HR-Analytics-Project-2-Million-Employee-Records-using-R
Overview
This project analyzes Human Resource (HR) data from a multinational corporation (MNC) containing 2 million employee records. The dataset includes employee demographics, job-related attributes, salary details, performance ratings, and employment status. The goal is to perform HR analytics using R and answer 15 key business questions on workforce distribution, attrition, performance, salary trends, and hiring patterns.
The analysis combines data wrangling, statistical tests, and visualizations to deliver actionable insights for HR.
Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle: ðŸ‘‰ HR Data Complete Analysis â€“ Kaggle
 Key Analyses (Q1â€“Q15)
1.	Distribution of Employee Status (Active, Resigned, Retired, Terminated)
2.	Distribution of Work Modes (On-site vs Remote)
3.	Number of Employees in Each Department
4.	Average Salary by Department
5.	Job Title with the Highest Average Salary
6.	Average Salary by Department & Job Title
7.	Resigned & Terminated Employees per Department
8.	Salary vs. Years of Experience (with and without outliers)
9.	Average Performance Rating by Department
10.	Country with the Highest Employee Concentration
11.	Correlation between Performance Rating and Salary
12.	Hiring Trends Over Time (per year)
13.	Salary Comparison: Remote vs On-site (t-test + effect size)
14.	Top 10 Highest Paid Employees in Each Department
15.	Departments with the Highest Attrition Rate (Resigned %)

 Visualizations
-	The project generates multiple plots:
-	Bar charts and pie charts for categorical distributions
-	Boxplots to analyze salary & performance variation
-	Line plots for trends (salary vs experience, hiring per year)
-	Scatter plots with regression lines to check correlations
-	Faceted charts for department-level insights
-	Geographic maps for employee distribution by country
How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/motawia/hr-analytics.git
 Results
ïƒ˜	Salary distribution and performance vary across different departments.
ïƒ˜	Attrition rates highlight the most vulnerable departments.
ïƒ˜	Remote vs On-site employees show no significant salary difference (confirmed by statistical tests and effect size).
ïƒ˜	Hiring trends reveal key workforce expansion periods.
